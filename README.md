NIST Sample Repository 
NIST Metals [Sample Repository](https://sample.nist.gov) is being developed to help track and link metal samples and results using a customized version of the NIST CDCS software (Configurable Data Curation System https://cdcs.nist.gov/ ). This document provides an overview of the structure of the repository and answers to frequently asked questions.

The current repository is focused on general metal alloys samples and additive manufactured build plates and samples. In addition to schemas describing the samples, serval measurement schemas are in progress. This repository is also being developed to link with other NIST resources including the [NexusLIMS](https://nexuslims.nist.gov/) (microscopy repository), the [PhaseData](https://phasedata.nist.gov/) repository, and the [TRC Metal Alloy Data](https://trc.nist.gov/MetalsAlloyUI/) repository.
